        <strong>Step 1: Choose a music file.</strong> Click the
        <code>Song File</code> tab and pick your song via a YouTube URL or local
        file. Easy. Click `Start Separation` to start the process of creating
        the instrumental track while you work on the rest of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 2: Prepare the lyrics.</strong> Paste song lyrics into the
        <code>Lyrics</code> box. Next, divide them up into screens by adding a
        blank line between the last line of one screen and the first line of the
        next. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> listen to the song once while reading
        the lyrics, to make sure all the lyrics are there. Sometimes the
        Internet is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 3: Add Timing Information.</strong> You're gonna tell The
        T端端l when all those lyrics appear in the song. When you hit the Play
        button, the song will start playing, and the first lyric-bit that you
        chopped up will be highlighted in pink.
        <strong>Hit the spacebar</strong> when that lyric comes up, and then the
        next lyric will turn pink and await your spacebar-press.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you hit the <strong>Enter</strong> key while the song is playing,
        that will mark the end of the <strong>previous</strong> lyric. Do that
        when there's a gap between lines or words. It can be tricky to handle
        both the spacebar and the enter key. If the song is going too fast, slow
        it down by clicking a different playback speed.
      </p>
      <p>If you need to take a break, hit the Pause button.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 4: Create The Video.</strong> After you've given an Enter
        press to the last lyric in the song, you can watch the preview, fiddle
        with fonts and colors, and click the <code>Submit</code> button. Wait
        5-10 minutes. Eventually you'll be asked to download a zip file. Inside
        that zip is an <code>.mp4</code> file which is your karaoke video! The
        zip file also includes generated <code>subtitles.ass</code> and
        <code>timings.json</code> files that were used to make your video. You
        can upload them to the Song Info tab if you want to re-do your video
        without re-doing the timings.

          A (somewhat outdated) video demonstration of how to use this thing is

          A beta version of The T端端l is available at
          <a href="https://beta.the-tuul.com">beta.the-tuul.com</a>. Try making
          your song on the beta and play around with its new features. If
          something doesn't work, you can go back to regular ol'

      <h3>What's New</h3>
      <h5>0.10 - August 11, 2024</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Background Separation</strong> - Start creating the instrumental track while you work on the lyric timings. Multitasking!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Slower Playback</strong> - Options for even slower playback during lyric timings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bring Your Own Files</strong> - Use your own backing track, or song timings, by uploading them to the Advanced section of the Song Info tab.
        </li>
      <h5>0.9 - July 4, 2024</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>YouTube videos</strong> - You can now import a YouTube video
          instead of uploading a file. The video will be included in the final
          karaoke video, or you can disable `Use Background Video` on the
          preview page to just use the audio. Including the video will make the
          creation process take longer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Local Video Creation</strong> - After the instrumental track
          is created, the actual video creation process is done on your computer
          instead of in the cloud. This is going to allow for some cool stuff in
          the future.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>0.8.1 - February 4, 2024</h5>

        <li>
          <strong>Early Lyric Display</strong> - When the first line on a screen
          comes right after the last line on the previous screen, the line will
          appear early.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Subtitle Compatibility</strong> - Subtitles can now be opened
          in Aegisub and other subtitle editors.
